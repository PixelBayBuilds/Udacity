            <li class="list"> <b>Meditation:</b> In mindfulness meditation, we’re learning how to pay attention to the breath as it goes in and out, and notice when the mind wanders from this task. This practice of returning to the breath builds the muscles of attention and mindfulness.
    
    When we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present moment—to anchor ourselves in the here and now.
            </li>
                <br>
